# Tines API Scripts
- original idea was for Git-Sync concept (abandoned due to limitations)
- now, a set of scripts for getting data out of or into a tenant
- useful for tines_get.py against events for troubleshooting (full payloads)
- also can compare the contents of one tenant with another for migrations
